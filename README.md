# WSO2-APIM40-Analytics-ChoreoConnect
This is a demo configuration of using APIM 4.0 with Choreo Insights for recording Analytics of APIM in the Cloud.

Please see: https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.0.0/api-analytics/getting-started-guide/
Please see: https://github.com/BechtelCanDoIt/WSO2-APIM40-Analytics-ChoreoConnect/blob/main/APIM_4.0_Analytics_Via_Choreo_Insights.pdf


NOTE: This demo doesn't actually utilize Choreo Connect like I thought when I started. Instead it uses API Gateway to talk to the Choreo service(s).
